This tool allows you to list any _node_modules_ directories in your system, as well as the space they take up. You can then select which ones you want to erase to free up space. Yay!

# :heavy_check_mark: Features

- **Clear space:** Get rid of old and dusty _node_modules_ cluttering up your machine.

- **Last Workspace Usage**: Check when was the last time you modified a file in the workspace (indicated in the **last_mod** column).

- **Very fast:** NPKILL is written in TypeScript, but searches are performed at a low level, improving performance greatly.

- **Easy to use:** Say goodbye to lengthy commands. Using npkill is as simple as reading a list of your node_modules, and pressing Del to get rid of them. Could it be any easier? ;)

- **Minified:** It barely has any dependencies.

<a name="installation"></a>

# :cloud: Installation

You don't really need to install it to use it!
Simply use the following command:

```bash
$ npx npkill
```

Or if for some reason you really want to install it:

```bash
$ npm i -g npkill
# Unix users may need to run the command with sudo. Go carefully
```

> NPKILL does not support node<v14. If this affects you you can use `npkill@0.8.3`

<a name="usage"></a>

# :clipboard: Usage

```bash
$ npx npkill
# or just npkill if installed globally
```

By default, npkill will scan for node_modules starting at the path where `npkill` command is executed.

Move between the listed folders with <kbd>↓</kbd> <kbd>↑</kbd>, and use <kbd>Space</kbd> or <kbd>Del</kbd> to delete the selected folder.
You can also use <kbd>j</kbd> and <kbd>k</kbd> to move between the results.

You can open the directory where the selected result is placed by pressing <kbd>o</kbd>.

To exit, <kbd>Q</kbd> or <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>c</kbd> if you're brave.

**Important!** Some applications installed on the system need their node_modules directory to work and deleting them may break them. NPKILL will highlight them by displaying a :warning: to be careful.

## Multi-Select Mode

This mode allows you to select and delete multiple folders at once, making it more efficient when cleaning up many directories.

### Entering Multi-Select Mode

Press <kbd>T</kbd> to toggle multi-select mode. When active, you'll see a selection counter and additional instructions at the top of the results.

### Controls

- **<kbd>Space</kbd>**: Toggle selection of the current folder.
- **<kbd>V</kbd>**: Start/end range selection mode.
- **<kbd>A</kbd>**: Toggle select/unselect all folders.
- **<kbd>Enter</kbd>**: Delete all selected folders.
- **<kbd>T</kbd>**: Unselect all and back to normal mode.

### Range Selection

After pressing <kbd>V</kbd> to enter range selection mode:

- Move the cursor with arrow keys, <kbd>j</kbd>/<kbd>k</kbd>, <kbd>Home</kbd>/<kbd>End</kbd>, or page up/down
- All folders between the starting position and current cursor position will be selected/deselected
- Press <kbd>V</kbd> again to exit range selection mode

**Warning:** _In future versions some commands may change_

<a name="examples"></a>

## Examples

- Search **node_modules** directories in your _projects_ directory:

```bash
npkill -d ~/projects

# other alternative:
cd ~/projects
npkill
```

- List directories named "dist" and show errors if any occur:

```bash
npkill --target dist -e
```

- List **vendor** directories in your _projects_ directory, sort by size, and show size in gb:

```bash
npkill -d '~/more projects' --size-unit gb --sort size --target vendor
```

- List **node_modules** in your _projects_ directory, excluding the ones in _progress_ and _ignore-this_ directories:

```bash
npkill -d 'projects' --exclude "progress, ignore-this"
```

- Automatically delete all node_modules that have sneaked into your backups:

```bash
npkill -d ~/backups/ --delete-all
```

- Get results in JSON format for automation or further processing:

```bash
npkill --json > results.json
```

- Stream results in real-time as JSON (useful for monitoring or piping to other tools):

```bash
npkill --json-stream | jq '.'
```

- Save only successful results to a file, ignoring errors:

```bash
npkill --json-stream 2>/dev/null | jq -s '.' > clean-results.json
```

<a name="json-output"></a>

## JSON Output

Npkill supports JSON output formats for automation and integration with other tools:

- **`--json`**: Output all results as a single JSON object at the end of the scan
- **`--json-stream`**: Output each result as a separate JSON object in real-time

For detailed documentation, examples, and TypeScript interfaces, see [JSON Output Documentation](./docs/json-output.md).

**Quick Examples:**

```bash
# Get all results as JSON
npkill --json > results.json

# Process results in real-time
npkill --json-stream | jq '.result.path'

# Find directories larger than 100MB
npkill --json | jq '.results[] | select(.size > 104857600)'
```

<a name="setup-locally"></a>

# :pager: Set Up Locally

```bash
# -- First, clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/voidcosmos/npkill.git

# -- Navigate to the dir
cd npkill

# -- Install dependencies
npm install

# -- And run!
npm run start


# -- If you want to run it with some parameter, you will have to add "--" as in the following example:
npm run start -- -f -e
```

<a name="API"></a>

# :bookmark_tabs: API

The api allows you to interact with npkill from node to create your own implementations in your scripts (automations, for example).

You can check the basic API [here](./API.md) or on the web (comming soon).

<a name="roadmap"></a>

# :crystal_ball: Roadmap

- [x] Release 0.1.0 !
- [x] Improve code
  - [x] Improve performance
  - [ ] Improve performance even more!
- [x] Sort results by size and path
- [x] Allow the search for other types of directories (targets)
- [ ] Reduce dependencies to be a more minimalist module
- [ ] Allow to filter by directories that have not been used in a period of time
- [ ] Create option for displaying directories in tree format
- [x] Add some menus
- [x] Add log service
- [ ] Periodic and automatic cleaning (?)

<a name="known-bugs"></a>

# :bug: Known bugs :bug:

- Sometimes, CLI is blocked while folder is deleting.
- Some terminals that do not use TTY (like git bash in windows) do not work.
- Sorting, especially by routes, can slow down the terminal when there are many results at the same time.
- Sometimes, size calculations are higher than they should be.
- (SOLVED) Performance issues when searching from high level directories (like / in linux).
- (SOLVED) Sometimes text collapses when updating the cli.
- (SOLVED) Analyzing the size of the directories takes longer than it should.

> If you find any bugs, don't hesitate and open an issue :)

We have developed npkill in our free time, because we are passionate about the programming sector.
Tomorrow we would like to dedicate ourselves to this, but first, we have a long way to go.

We will continue to do things anyway, but donations are one of the many ways to support what we do.
