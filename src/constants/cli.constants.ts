These folders are essential while you’re actively working on a project, but over time they pile up, eating tons of space long after you’ve moved on.
Npkill scans your directories, lists these directories with their sizes, and shows when you last touched each project, so you can quickly decide what to keep and what to clean. Easy!

${getHeader('How to interact')}
 ${pc.green('SPACE / DEL')}             Delete selected result.
 ${pc.green('↑ / k')}                   Move up.
 ${pc.green('↓ / j')}                   Move down.
 ${pc.green('→ / ←')}                   Switch between panels.
 ${pc.green('t')}                       Multi-selection mode.
 ${pc.green('PgUp / Ctrl+u / u / h')}   Move one page up.
 ${pc.green('PgDown / Ctrl+d / d / l')} Move one page down.
 ${pc.green('Home, End')}               Jump to first / last result.
 ${pc.green('o')}                       Open the parent directory.
 ${pc.green('/')}                       Search (Regex supported).
 ${pc.green('e')}                       Show errors.

 (green) Results ready (stats calculated).
